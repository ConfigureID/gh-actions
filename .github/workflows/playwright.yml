name: Playwright E2E Testing - Simple

# Reusable workflow to test E2E using Playwright using a single VM
#
# It contains a single job with a single step to call the Playwright action without sharding, so it will
# - Install the dependencies (node_modules and Playwright browsers)
# - Run tests on a single VM
# - Generate the JSON/XML results and HTML report
# - Upload them as artifacts
#
# This is the same as simply calling the action. It is created as a reusable workflow to make the call 
# more similar to the shared version (where using a reusable workflow is actually useful). 
# Just add/remove the "-sharded" suffix and add/remove the number of shards
